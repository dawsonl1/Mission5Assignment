            <h2 class="h4">Why I like playing Fortnite</h2>
            <p>
                Fortnite is my favorite kind of game because it never takes itself too seriously.
                Every match feels different. Sometimes I have a plan. Sometimes I land, panic,
                and immediately start running in the wrong direction.
            </p>
            <p>
                I like the bright art style, the random items, and the fact that winning is never guaranteed.
                Even when I lose badly, it usually happens in a way that is funny enough to make it worth it.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
                The best games are always with friends. Even when I am getting carried, I still feel involved
                because Fortnite somehow makes chaos feel collaborative.
            </p>

            <span class="card-tag">Strategy™</span>
            <h2 class="h4">My playstyle (if you can call it that)</h2>
            <p>
                My strategy is very simple: land somewhere calm, collect loot, and then confidently rotate
                directly into danger. When I encounter someone who can build faster than I can think,
                I place exactly one wall and hope for the best.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
                I am fully aware that this is not optimal gameplay. However, it is extremely entertaining,
                and that is the metric I care about the most.

                This image perfectly captures my Fortnite experience: standing still, holding a brightly colored item, and staring at something that is clearly not important while danger almost certainly exists somewhere off screen. I feel prepared, confident, and completely unaware of what is about to happen next.

        <p>
            My favorite skin to play as is the Sabrina Carpenter skin. Not because it gives me any
            advantage (it does not), but because I think it is genuinely funny when Sabrina Carpenter
            wins a Fortnite match.

        <p>
            Seeing a pop star character standing there with a
            <span class="fw-semibold">#1 Victory Royale</span> banner after I spent the entire game
            making questionable decisions feels incredibly undeserved in the best possible way.

            Skins do nothing for gameplay, but this one dramatically improves the emotional impact of winning,
            which is rare enough that it deserves to be memorable.
